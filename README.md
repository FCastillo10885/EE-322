Some facts about me
- I am a first gen American and college student, my parents immigrated from Peru
- During COVID I learned a lot about computers and built one myself
- Since I was a kid, I always hoped to become an engineer
- Although I don't know much coding, I loved learning what I have and hope to expand my knowledge on it

Here's a simple C++ code that every coding student first learned
`cout << Hello World! << endl;`
